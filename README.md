I may take a while to respond or even forget a notification altogether. Feel free to ping me again if you think something requires my attention and I have not reacted in a few weeks.

Currently, I prioritize the following:

- Serving in [Nix Steering Committee](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/governance.md)
- Maintaining GNOME desktop environment in [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)
- Maintaining [selfoss](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss) RSS reader

but I also work on lot of other [minor projects](https://github.com/jtojnar?tab=repositories&type=source&sort=stargazers) and [contribute](https://github.com/jtojnar?tab=repositories&q=&type=fork&sort=stargazers) [to many/most](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jtojnar) [open-source projects](https://gitlab.com/jtojnar) [I use](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/jtojnar).

This fills most of my on-line free time.

I tend to focus on one project more closely for a bit, before jumping to the next one. And if I do not manage to finish the work during the attention span, I will just leave it for the next cycle. As a result, a prolonged period of time may elapse before I get around to e.g. fixing a reported bug.
